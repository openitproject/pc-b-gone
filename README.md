PC-B-Gone: Y U NO BOOT ?
========================

Few times ago, I wrote a blogpost about USB short-circuits consequences on many devices (http://virtualabs.fr/Apres-le-TV-B-Gone-le-PC-B-Gone), after having experienced some trouble with one of my USB port. In the meanwhile, I developed this quick PoC and sent a lot of these USB sticks to almost all of the backers of the OpenIt Project.

Here is the PCB file (gEDA) I used to make them.
